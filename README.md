# Prizm - ZX Spectrum style graphics in your browser

A very silly toolkit for rendering ZX Spectrum style graphics in your browser. It's a bit like a very basic version of [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) but with a ZX Spectrum aesthetic.

It currently supports the following features:
- 256x192 resolution
- 16 colours - That's one more than the ZX Spectrum!
- 8x8 pixel font
- Colour clashing attribute system
- A simple API for drawing pixels, lines, rectangles, circles, and text

## Getting started

Have a look in the `apps/demo` directory for an example of how to use Prizm. 

Proper documentation is coming soon.
